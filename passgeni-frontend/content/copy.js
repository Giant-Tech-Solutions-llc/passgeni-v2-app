// ─── FAQ ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
export const FAQ = {
  eyebrow:  "Honest answers",
  headline: "Questions we would ask too.",
  items: [
    {
      question: "Does PassGeni store my passwords?",
      answer:   "Never — and it is technically impossible for us to. Every password is generated in your browser using JavaScript's crypto.getRandomValues() API. No data is sent to any server. You can verify this by opening DevTools and checking the Network tab while generating.",
    },
    {
      question: "How does AI make passwords more memorable?",
      answer:   "PassGeni seeds each password with a domain-relevant word from your profession. A developer might get 'kernel' buried in the character string. A doctor might get 'cortex'. The cryptographic randomness wrapping it stays identical — but you are 30% more likely to recognize it on sight, which means fewer resets.",
    },
    {
      question: "Are passphrases as secure as complex passwords?",
      answer:   "More so, in many cases. NIST Special Publication 800-63B specifically recommends passphrases over complex short passwords. Four random words provides over 50 bits of entropy — resisting all known brute-force and dictionary attacks for decades, while being easy enough to type on a TV remote.",
    },
    {
      question: "What does zero knowledge mean for a password generator?",
      answer:   "It means we have zero ability to know, store, or reconstruct your passwords — by design. Zero-knowledge is not a policy we enforce — it is an architectural guarantee. PassGeni runs entirely client-side. Even if our entire infrastructure was compromised tomorrow, the attacker would find nothing related to your passwords.",
    },
    {
      question: "What is Post-Quantum mode?",
      answer:   "Post-Quantum mode generates passwords aligned with NIST's 2024 post-quantum cryptographic standards. It uses longer character pools, avoids patterns vulnerable to Grover's algorithm, and produces credentials designed to withstand attacks from quantum computers — which are expected to break many current encryption methods within the next decade.",
    },
    {
      question: "What is the Password DNA Score?",
      answer:   "DNA Score is PassGeni's proprietary quality metric. It grades your password across 7 cryptographic checks — length thresholds, character class diversity, and repeat-character detection — and weights them by security impact. A+ means your password passes all checks. It is a human-readable health signal in addition to entropy analysis.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I use PassGeni for HIPAA or SOC 2 compliance?",
      answer:   "The Team plan includes compliance presets for HIPAA, SOC 2, ISO 27001, PCI-DSS, NIST 800-63B, and DoD requirements. Each preset automatically enforces the correct policy — minimum length, required character sets, and complexity rules for that specific standard.",
    },
    {
      question: "How does the Breach Checker work without storing my password?",
      answer:   "PassGeni uses k-anonymity via the HaveIBeenPwned API. Your password is hashed using SHA-1 client-side. Only the first 5 characters of that hash are sent to the API — never the full password. The API returns all hashes that match those 5 characters, and PassGeni checks locally if yours is among them. Your actual password never leaves your device.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I use PassGeni on my phone?",
      answer:   "Yes. PassGeni is fully responsive and works in any modern mobile browser. No app download required. Open passgeni.ai and start generating.",
    },
    {
      question: "What happens if I forget my password?",
      answer:   "PassGeni does not store your passwords — which means we cannot recover them. That is by design. We recommend storing the passwords PassGeni generates in a password manager like Bitwarden or 1Password.",
    },
    {
      question: "Is PassGeni really free? What is the catch?",
      answer:   "Genuinely free — 15 passwords per day, no account required, no ads, no tracking. We make money from Pro ($9/month) and Team ($29/month) plans for users who need higher limits, compliance presets, and API access. No catch.",
